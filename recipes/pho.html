            <h2>What is Phở?</h2>
            <p>Pho, pronounced as “Fuh” in the tone of a question, is the national dish of Vietnam. It originated in the early 20th century in Northern Vietnam and made popular all over the world by refugees after the Vietnam War.</p>
            <p>The two most popular types of pho noodle soups are chicken pho (Pho Ga) and beef pho (Pho Bo). In this recipe, we will be focusing on Southern-style beef pho.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 lbs beef bones</li>
                <li>5 quarts water</li>
                <li>8 large shallots</li>
                <li>3-inch ginger</li>
                <li>1 stick Chinese cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried cloves</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried coriander</li>
                <li>3 dried cardamom</li>
                <li>3 dried star anise</li>
                <li>30 grams rock sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sea salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tablespoon MSG (optional)</li>
                <li>Any meat from beef bones after making stock</li>
                <li>1-1/2 lbs thinly sliced eye-round beef steak</li>
                <li>1 11-oz bag cooked beef balls</li>
                <li>2 lbs fresh rice noodles</li>
                <li>1 white/yellow onion (slice thinly)</li>
                <li>1 small bunch cilantro (roughly chop)</li>
                <li>5 green onions/scallions (slice thinly)</li>
                <li>3 jalapenos (slice thinly)</li>
                <li>3 limes (cut into wedges)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instruction</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cleaning the bones will get rid of all the impurities and ensure a clear broth. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add beef bones and boil for 8 minutes or until foam float to the top. If using marrow bones, boil for only 3 minutes. Any longer will remove the marrow, which would not be good. Remove the bones from the pot and rinse the bones well under cold running water. Discard the water and clean the pot.</li>
                <li>Peel the shallots and slice the ginger into thick coins. Transfer shallots and ginger to a baking tray and roast in the toaster oven at 400°F for 20 minutes or until lightly charred on the edges.</li>
                <li>In the clean pot, add water (5 quarts) and bring to a boil. Add cleaned bones, shallots, and ginger. Cook for 2 hours, uncovered on a low simmer. Occasionally, use a ladle or mesh strainer to skim off any impurities that float to the top and discard.</li>
                <li>Remove all the aromatics and bones from the stock and discard. There may be a good amount of tender meat on the bones so remove the meat from the bones and set aside as a meaty topping before discarding bones.</li>
                <li>In a small frying pan, dry roast (no oil) the spices for about 30 seconds or until fragrant. Shake them around to prevent burning. Wrap the roasted spices in a cheesecloth or if you are using the pho spice seasoning packet, use the accompanying spice bag. Add to stockpot. Simmer on low for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the spice packet.</li>
                <li>Season stock with rock sugar, fish sauce, salt and MSG (optional). Start with a little at a time and adjust to your taste.</li>
                <li>Cook rice noodles per package instructions. Divide noodles evenly between eight bowls. Add your choices of meat with the raw slices of eye-round beef steak on top. Ladle hot broth over the raw beef slices. Top with a bit of white/yellow onions, green onions, and cilantro. Serve with hoisin and sriracha sauce, and a small platter of bean sprouts, Thai basil, jalapenos, lime, and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
