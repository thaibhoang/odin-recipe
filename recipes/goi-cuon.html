        <h2>So what are Vietnamese spring rolls or gỏi cuốn?    </h2>
        <p>Gỏi cuốn literally means salad rolls, and for the longest time I never made that connection. I just assumed it was a random name for these rolls, silly me.</p>
        <p>But these tasty little rice paper rolls are indeed an herby salad mixture, with pork, shrimp, and rice noodles. Dip it in as much sauce (or should we say salad dressing) as you’d like. I love gỏi cuốn–they’re tasty and fun to eat. They’re great as a communal meal where everyone is rolling their own at the table.</p>

        <h2>Instruction</h2>
        <h3>COOKING PORK</h3>
        <ol>        
            <li>Add pork, onion, salt and sugar to a small pot and add enough water to cover about 1 inch above the pork. Bring to a boil on high heat and then lower to medium and cook for about 25-30 minutes or until pork juices run clear when poked at the thickest part, or it registers 145 F with an instant read thermometer at the thickest part.        </li>
            <li>Cover the pork in a bowl as it cools so it doesn't darken. Once cool, slice the pork as thinly as you can to make rolling easier later.        </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>COOKING SHRIMP</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Defrost shrimp in water bowl. Once defrosted, de-vein the shrimp. Hold a shrimp up to a light to locate the vein, pierce the whiter part (joint) of the shrimp just below the vein with a toothpick, and pull the toothpick upwards towards the shrimp back. Do this slowly to remove the vein. Piece again at another joint if the vein breaks to remove all traces of vein. Repeat with all your shrimp.        </li>
            <li>Cook the shrimp: add shrimp, salt, and enough water in a small pot to barely cover your shrimp. Boil on medium-high heat for only about 1.5 to 2.5 minutes or until the shrimp is no longer translucent. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process.        </li>
            <li>Remove the shells and tails from shrimp, and cut the shrimp in half along the body.        </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>RICE NOODLES</h3>
        <ol><li>Cook either your rice noodles according to the package instructions. Timing can vary wildly depending on noodle thickness and brand. This can be anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes. Drain and cool the noodles under cold, running water to stop it from cooking further.    </li></ol>
        <h3>VEGGIES</h3>
        <ol><li>Prepare your vegetables by rinsing and drying them.    </li></ol>
